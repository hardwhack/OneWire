OneWire library for Arduino using internal pull-up resistor.

Playing with a DS18B20 temperature sensor, I plugged in the one wire (plus ground and power). My sensor did not work without external resistors. I was not using parasitic power and wondered if the internal pull-up resistor would work. I made a few changes (6 lines) to turn on the internal pull-up after every read access to the OneWire pin. It seems to work just fine.
